Despite their success in downstream tasks such as cyberbullying, sentiment analysis, and question retrieval, they exhibit gender sterotypes which raises concerns because their widespread use can amplify these biases. \n",

        "* Words with similar semantic meaning will be close to each other \n",
        "* The difference between word embedding vectors can represent relationships between words. For example, given the analogy \"man is to King as woman is to $x$\" (denoted as $man:king :: woman:x$), by doing simple arithmetic on the embedding vectors, we find that $x = queen$ is the best answer because $\\vec{man} - \\vec{woman} ≈ \\vec{king} - \\vec{queen}$. For the analogy $Paris:France :: Nairobi:x$, finds that $x = Kenya$. These embeddings can also amplify sexism implicit in text. For instance, $\\vec{man} - \\vec{woman} ≈ \\vec{computer \\space programmer} - \\vec{homemaker}$. The same system that produced reasonable answers to the previous examples offensively answers \"man is to computer programmer as woman is to $x$\" with $x = homemaker$.\n",
